bat
===========

_a cat(1) clone with wings_

Helper for setup of [`bat`](https://github.com/sharkdp/bat).

Includes a Sublime Text theme which fairly closely matches the [vim theme](../vim/.vim/colors/mafro.vim)
based on [`sonph/onehalf`](https://github.com/sonph/onehalf). `bat` loads this theme via an
environment variable `BAT_THEME`, which is set in [`.zshrc`](../zsh/.zshrc).
